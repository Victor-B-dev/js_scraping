This repository is for learning about using three different web-scraping technologies.

Will likely rename the repo/split the technologies for use cases as I figure out the scope of each subproject.

The three ones in here will be:

Puppeteer
Cheerio - only works on static HTML elements - many modern websites will break this because content is dynamically loaded
Playwright

I'd like to explore Selenium at a later time for Python practice.
